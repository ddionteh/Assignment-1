# Front-End Development Assignment 1: Overview
# Project Overview

Our project is a dynamic and interactive website designed to cater to a diverse audience seeking inspiration, information, and engagement for free. The core components of our website include a Quotes page, a Sign-up form, a Home page, and an About Us section. Each element is meticulously crafted to provide a user-friendly experience and valuable content.

The Quotes page is a unique feature allowing users to engage with a wide array of quotes. It includes functionalities such as commenting, filtering, and categorizing, enabling users to interact and find quotes that resonate with their interests and needs.

The Sign-up form is designed for ease of use, encouraging users to join our community. It is a gateway for users to access more personalized content and engage more deeply with our platform, such as commenting on individual quotes and discussing with other users using the comment section.

The Home page serves as the welcoming point of our website, offering a snapshot of what we offer and guiding users to various sections according to their interests.

The About Us section delves into our mission, values, and story, offering a transparent view of who we are and what we aim to achieve.

# Design Process
The first thing users see when they open the Home page, is a world of void, only stars and 2 philosophers in deep thought, with the rapid movement of stars representing the long hours, indicates that the duo are immersed. A world of void represents the world from their perspective, unimportant, as they only care about what's in their mind.
Quote of the day and Philosophers of the day is meant to introduce users to Philosophy.
Theme is mostly white and black, signifying that everything in this world is meaningless (colorless), but it's humans that give meaning to it.
Categories section are at the top of the page in Quotes page, so that users can easily filter when they first enter the page. This also makes it easy to locate the filter feature.
Background images in About Us page showcases philosophers of the past, further reinforcing what our website is about.
