Front-End Development Assignment 1: Overview
Project Overview

Our project is a dynamic and interactive website designed to cater to a diverse audience seeking inspiration, information, and engagement. The core components of our website include a Quotes page, a Sign-up form, a Home page, and an About Us section. Each element is meticulously crafted to provide a user-friendly experience and valuable content.

The Quotes page is a unique feature allowing users to engage with a wide array of quotes. It includes functionalities such as commenting, filtering, and categorizing, enabling users to interact and find quotes that resonate with their interests and needs.

The Sign-up form is designed for ease of use, encouraging users to join our community. It is a gateway for users to access more personalized content and engage more deeply with our platform.

The Home page serves as the welcoming point of our website, offering a snapshot of what we offer and guiding users to various sections according to their interests.

The About Us section delves into our mission, values, and story, offering a transparent view of who we are and what we aim to achieve.
